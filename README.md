Enhancing Load Approval Process using Machine Learning

This project aims to enhance the loan approval process through data-driven insights, striking a crucial balance between fairness to borrowers and effective risk management for lending institutions.

I have applied multiple Machine Learning models to evaluate the score and considered the model with the highest score.

Future Works: Looking forward to implement more ML models to achieve a greater score.
